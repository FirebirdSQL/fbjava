=================================
   Example project for FB/Java
=================================

Prerequisites
=============

Java SE Development Kit 8 (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp) [may work with JRE]
Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org)


Preparing
=========

Make sure JAVA_HOME is correctly defined and points to a Java of the same architecture (32 or 64
bit) of Firebird.

Set FIREBIRD environment variable.

Set FBJAVA_ROOT environment variable.

Go to this example's root directory.

Run mvn package
(If you're new to Maven, it's normal that it will start downloading a lot of files on the first run)

Run util/createdb.{sh,bat} script.

Optionally create a database named employee in PostgreSQL with user name postgres and password
postgres.

Open the postgres employee database, create this table and insert some records.
    create table employee (id integer, name varchar(60));


Testing
=======

Connect to db.fdb. Some things to play with:

-- Lets see what Java says about our OS name, directly calling a standard method:
select get_system_property('os.name') from rdb$database;

-- Lets call a method that we created:
select regex_replace('foo', '123 foo 456', 'bar') from rdb$database;

-- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on the employee table. All actions will be logged in db.log file.
insert into employee values (1, 'Juliet Burke');
insert into employee values (2, 'Kate Austen');
insert into employee values (3, 'John Locke');

-- This is dumb example, but you may use same concept to make cross database queries.
select * from employee_local;

-- This is same concept and implementation, but read data from the postgres database!
select * from employee_pgsql;

-- You can now open util/code.sql and see how the postgres query is created. Create another SP based
-- on a Firebird database just replacing jdbc:postgresql:employee|postgres|postgres by
-- jdbc:firebirdsql:database|user|password

-- After change .java files, run mvn package and util/replace-jar.{sh,bat} script.

-- Now you can do queries with multiple external datasources, of different DBMSs!

select * from employee_local
union all
select * from employee_pgsql;

select *
  from employee_local el
  join employee_pgsql ep
    on ep.id = el.id;

insert into employee
  select * from employee_pgsql;
